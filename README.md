Project Name: Crop and Weed Detection using Machine Learning
Project Description  
This project uses a machine learning model to differentiate between crops and weeds  based on image data. It helps in precision agriculture by automating weed detection, reducing manual effort, and improving crop yield.  

			
 Features  
•	Identifies crops and weeds from images.  
•	Uses a trained ML model for classification.  
•	Works with Jupyter Notebook in VS Code  
•	Provides visual outputs for analysis.  


 Tech Stack  
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries Used:
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	TensorFlow/Keras
•	OpenCV
•	Scikit-learn.
•	NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

│   │   ├── weed


Model Training
To train the model inside Jupyter Notebook:
from train import train_model  # Example function in train.py
train_model(epochs=50, batch_size=32)
Visualizing training progress (loss/accuracy graphs)
Final model performance metrics

Results & Output
•	Sample output using Matplotlib/OpenCV
•	Correct vs incorrect detections with images
